# LichessHack
Allows an AI to play moves for you on a User Account

1) Log into Lichess with an account you don't want to get banned
2) Challenge someone to a lichess game
3) Paste in the javascript code located in hack.js into the webpage console

The AI will start making moves and stuff

## The current bot is FurryBot that I made here: [FurryBot](https://github.com/ManzanaNaranja/FurryBot)
-it is not that good so in the meantime, I plan to replace it with the javascript version of stockfish soon
